The inspiration for this project comes from the chapter no. 12 from the book called "Practical Machine Learning for Computer 
Vision" ([link](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/practical-machine-learning/9781098102357/ "optional-title"))
The main tasks were to wrap up the given code in the object-oriented programming manner and experiment with different type of the
architecture (particularly with regard to the decoder part of the model). Additionally, code was extended, for example 
saving and loading customized models were introduced. As a result, knowledge regarding tensorflow framework was enhanced. 

The project is still in the development phase, in the future it will be extended by:

1. Predicting and visualizing capabilities
2. Unit tests that will assure code quality and validity
